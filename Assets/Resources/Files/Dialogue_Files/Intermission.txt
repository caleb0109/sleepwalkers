H-Neutral|Are you alright?  Why are you making so much noise this early in the morning? Did you fall down the stairs?
Y-Neutral|Yeah, I’m just a little banged up. Did I wake you up?
H-Neutral|No, I have to leave for work in a bit. Don’t forget to do your chores, Mom’ll be checking everything once she gets home.
