Y-Neutral|Where is it?
S-Neutral|Why are you digging through the trash?
Y-Embarassed|Someone threw away a picture I need for... a class.
S-Neutral|Can't you just print out another one?
Y-Neutral|...
Y-Embarassed|I don't have the file.
S-Neutral|...
S-Neutral|I saw the janitor take out the trash from that can a few minutes ago. She probably still has the contents with her.
Y-Embarassed|Thank you.
