Y-Confused|Where is it?
S-Confused|Why are you digging through the trash?
Y-Anxious|Someone threw away a picture I need for... a class.
S-Confused|Can't you just print out another one?
Y-Neutral|...
Y-Neutral|I don't have the file.
S-Neutral|...
S-Neutral|I saw the janitor take out the trash from that can a few minutes ago. She probably still has the contents with her.
Y-Neutral|Thank you.
